// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

    If num1 % 2 == 0 then print "EVEN"
    if num1 % 2 != 0 then print "ODD"

// Exercise 3: 


Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    


a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


    A)
        1. ask for 5 numbers
    B)
        1. num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = total
        2. average = total / 5

    C) 
        1. sort the 5 numbers in order from least to greatest.
        2. set the variable "smallest" equal to the first number in the list.
        3. set the variable "largest" equal to the last number in the list.
    D) 
        1. print ("the average of the 5 numbers is: " + average)
        2. print("the smallest of the 5 numbers is: " + smallest)
        3. print("the largest of the 5 numbers is: " + largest)
